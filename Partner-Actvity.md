## Partner Activity (GitHub Refresh)

### Add Alias to Shell
- Add an alias, **lol** that does the following:
    - `git lol --oneline --graph --decorate --all`

### Step 1
- 
- Add your partner as a collaborator to your copy of the [`github-games`](https://github.com/opsgilityschool/github-games) repository.
- Clone your partner's repository to your local machine.
- Use `git clone URL repo-name` to give the repository a different name
- Create a branch called `partner-instructions` in your partner's repo.
- Add instructions (or any text) for playing the game (beginning at line 7) to the README.md
- Push your branch to your partner's repo and open a pull request.

### Step 2
After your partner has completed Step 1:
- Go back to your copy of the game
- Merge the `game-instructions` branch in your own repo (you can use a pull request or do it locally).
- Go to the pull request your partner created and resolve any merge conflicts in your own repo.

### Step 3 (Extra Credit)
After you've completed the previous two steps, can you get the game working?
 - Setup a GitHub Pages site for your game
 - Have it launch the game when you visit the page
